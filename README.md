This project uses Python to analyze the performance of a portfolio of stocks. The data used is a CSV file containing historical stock returns for a set of stocks.

The code calculates various portfolio performance metrics, such as the Sharpe ratio, the Sortino ratio, and the maximum drawdown. The code also produces a set of visualizations that analyze the performance of the portfolio, including a distribution plot of the portfolio returns, a line chart of the portfolio return over time, and a heatmap of the correlation between the stock returns.
